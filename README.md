# Windows 10 Hardening

## Introduction

This is a hardening checklist that can be used in private and business environments for hardening Windows 10. The checklist can be used for all Windows versions, but in Windows 10 Home the Group Policy Editor is not integrated and the adjustment must be done directly in the registry. 

The settings should be seen as security and privacy recommendation and should be carefully checked whether they will affect the operation of your infrastructure or impact the usability of key functions. It is important to weigh security against usability.

## Policy Analyzer

_Policy Analzyer_ reads out and compares local registry and local policy values to a defined baseline. The PolicyRule file from [aha-181](https://github.com/aha-181) contains all rules which are needed to check Group Policy and Registry settings that are defined in the Windows 10 Hardening checklist.

Policy Analyzer supports the Hardening checklist up to version 0.2.0, additional entries are not yet supported. 

## HardeningKitty

_HardeningKitty_ supports hardening of a Windows system. The configuration of the system is retrieved and assessed using a finding list. In addition, the system can be hardened according to predefined values. _HardeningKitty_ reads settings from the registry and uses other modules to read configurations outside the registry.
